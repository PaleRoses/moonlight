-- | A repair run report, not a certificate. Every judgment it carries is
-- relative to the caller-supplied 'Kernel': 'ResultConverged'
-- means the kernel's own check accepted the state, so the constructors stay
-- public — fabricating a result asserts nothing that supplying a vacuous
-- kernel could not already assert. Truthfulness relative to a given kernel is
-- the post-condition of 'boundedRepair', never an invariant of this type.

-- | A round-by-round account of a repair run, in chronological order. Like
-- 'Result' it is a description relative to the kernel that produced it;
-- consumers may construct traces directly (an empty trace is the natural
-- seed for accumulation) because the type never promises the run happened.
