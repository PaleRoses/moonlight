{-| The primary entry point to @moonlight-category@, re-exporting the categorical
layer as a single convenience surface.

The base abstraction is "Moonlight.Category.Pure.Category": a totalised,
explicit-error @Category@ class whose objects, morphisms, 2-morphisms, compositors
and errors are associated types and whose operations return @Either@. On top of it
this module gathers the limit and colimit class tower, the higher-category tower
(2-categories, bicategories, monoidal and enriched categories), runtime-validated
finite categories (@FinCat@) with their thin and composable-chain variants,
core/automorphism groupoid extraction, the adhesive and PBPO rewriting witnesses,
structured cospans, double categories, decorated composition and presentation,
Galois connections, polynomial functors, covering families, and the site/path
presentation layer.

@UnitCat@ is the terminal one-object category, useful as a base case and in tests.

For direct finite-category authoring, import
"Moonlight.Category.Presentation". For scoped mathematical operations on an
already-compiled finite category, import "Moonlight.Category.Notation".

The indexed, typed-arrow layer is exposed separately as "Moonlight.Category.Indexed".
