`moonlight-category` is Moonlight's categorical tier. Building on
[`moonlight-core`](../moonlight-core), it provides a totalised,
explicit-error category abstraction together with the finite, runtime-validated
categories and site/path presentations the compiler uses to model its own structure.

## Relationship to `data-category`

If you want general indexed category theory in Haskell, prefer Sjoerd Visscher's
[`data-category`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-category). Its typed-arrow
calculus is the primary inspiration for this package's indexed layer, and several
modules under `Moonlight.Category.Indexed` are adapted from it. Thank you to Sjoerd
Visscher for the design and implementation work in `data-category`.

## What it provides

- **A category abstraction.** The `Category` class is totalised: objects, morphisms,
  2-morphisms, compositors and a category-specific error type are associated types,
  and every operation returns `Either`.
- **Limits and colimits.** A class tower for products, coproducts, pullbacks,
  pushouts, equalizers and coequalizers.
- **Higher structure.** 2-categories, bicategories, monoidal and enriched categories.
- **Finite categories.** `FinCat`: runtime-validated finite categories with handles,
  bit-packed thin variants, composable chains and core/automorphism groupoid
  extraction.
- **Finite-category presentations.** `Moonlight.Category.Presentation` provides a
  focused authoring EDSL for finite posets and fully enumerated finite categories,
  compiling down to validated `FinCat`.
- **Sites and presentations.** Site manifests with validation, reachable-closure and
  import-cycle diagnostics, path categories, quotients, and compilation down to
  `FinCat`; an architecture front-end that assembles a site from layered module rows.
- **Rewriting witnesses.** Adhesive and PBPO pushout-complement witnesses, structured
  cospans, double categories, and decorated composition/presentation.
- **Indexed category theory.** The typed-arrow layer adapted from `data-category`.
- **Simplicial substrate.** Runtime-dimensional Δ morphisms, finite truncated
  simplicial sets, standard/boundary/horn spaces, nerves, Kan interfaces, and
  connected-component/core-groupoid queries over finite composable categories.

## Public modules

| Module | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `Moonlight.Category` | The broad categorical surface: `Category` and composition, the limit/colimit and higher-category towers, finite and thin categories, invertibility/groupoids, adhesive & PBPO witnesses, structured cospans, double categories, decorated composition, Galois connections, polynomial functors, covering families, and the site/path layer. |
| `Moonlight.Category.Indexed` | The indexed, typed-arrow category-theory layer adapted from `data-category`: indexed categories, functors, natural transformations, adjunctions, (co)limits, Kan extensions, products/coproducts and the simplex category. |
| `Moonlight.Category.Presentation` | The finite-category authoring surface: named objects, named nonidentity morphisms, strict-order `below` declarations, identities in equations, and compilation to `FinCat`. |
| `Moonlight.Category.Notation` | Scoped query and composition helpers for already-compiled `FinCat` values. |
| `Moonlight.Category.Simplicial` | The public simplicial surface: Δ, simplicial sets, nerves, Kan interfaces, homotopy queries, and pure validation. |

The `Moonlight.Category.Pure.*` leaves live in named implementation sublibraries:
`abstract` for generic category theory, `finite` for `FinCat`/presentation runtime,
`site` for site and path compilation, `indexed` for the adapted `data-category`
typed-arrow layer, and `simplicial` for Δ, simplicial sets, nerves and Kan
interfaces. The public law-suite lives in the `laws` sublibrary.

## Finite-category presentations

Use `Moonlight.Category.Presentation` to write finite categories declaratively.
Compilation always produces the validated runtime representation `FinCat`.

### Finite posets

`below` declares strict generating inequalities. Compilation takes the transitive
closure, rejects cycles, and supplies identities implicitly.

```haskell
import Moonlight.Category.Presentation

threeChain :: Either FinCatBuildError FinCat
threeChain =
  finCategory $ do
    [a, b, c] <- objects ["A", "B", "C"]
    below a b
    below b c
```

### Fully enumerated finite categories

In the general dialect, each call to `arrow` declares one actual nonidentity
morphism of the resulting category. Equations determine the nonidentity
composition table.

```haskell
import Moonlight.Category.Presentation

commutingTriangle :: Either FinCatBuildError FinCat
commutingTriangle =
  finCategory $ do
    a <- object "A"
    b <- object "B"
    c <- object "C"

    f <- arrow a b "f"
    g <- arrow b c "g"
    h <- arrow a c "h"

    equate (g `after` f) h
```

Identities may be named inside equations:

```haskell
inversePair :: Either FinCatBuildError FinCat
inversePair =
  finCategory $ do
    a <- object "A"
    b <- object "B"

    f <- arrow a b "f"
    g <- arrow b a "g"

    equate (g `after` f) (identityAt a)
    equate (f `after` g) (identityAt b)
```

Longer paths are accepted when their proper intermediate composites are determined
elsewhere in the presentation. Equation declaration order is irrelevant.

The presentation dialect accepts declared morphisms and equations over determined
composites. An equation such as `equate f g` for distinct declared morphisms is
rejected rather than silently identifying them.

For querying and composing morphisms after compilation, import
`Moonlight.Category.Notation` separately.

## Acknowledgements

The representation of finite and finitely-presented categories as concrete,
runtime-validated data structures, including `FinCat` and the site/path
presentations that compile down to it, was directly inspired by the
[AlgebraicJulia](https://www.algebraicjulia.org/) ecosystem and the work on attributed
C-sets (acsets), whose thesis is precisely that categorical objects can be realised as
performant data structures. The implementation here is independent; the conceptual
debt is real and gratefully acknowledged.
