Typed dense, sparse, finite-field, and Krylov linear algebra for Pale Meridian's
foundation packages.

`moonlight-linalg` is Moonlight's numerical linear-algebra tier. Building on
[`moonlight-core`](../moonlight-core) and
[`moonlight-algebra`](../moonlight-algebra), it provides the matrix, vector,
GF(2), sparse-storage, Smith-normal-form, eigen, and Krylov machinery used by
homology, analysis, sheaf, geometry, and solver packages.

The front door is the umbrella module `Moonlight.LinAlg`, whose header carries
the type-indexed `MoonlightError` contract, the role map across the public
surface, and the quick-start recipe. This page maps the public modules and the
benchmark tooling.

## Public modules

| Module | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg` | Broad public surface for dense, sparse, operator, spectral, domain, geometry, statics, and immutable Krylov modules. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Dense` | Dense vectors/matrices, validated dense-row authoring, GF(2), exterior algebra, basic operations, decompositions, field operations, direct solvers, and primitives. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Sparse` | Sparse matrix carriers, packed sparse operators, sealed preconditioner families, and sparse iterative solvers. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Operator` | Abstract affine-normalized linear operators with explicit self-adjoint construction boundaries. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Spectral` | Eigenvalue/eigenpair requests and contiguous result views, dispatched by demand and operator structure above Krylov. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Krylov` | Public Arnoldi/Lanczos decomposition, projected tridiagonal/block-tridiagonal carriers, and block Lanczos surface. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Native` | Effectful native LAPACK backend boundary. On macOS it links Accelerate; elsewhere it expects BLAS/LAPACK libraries. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Domain` | Domain-level algebraic operations, including Smith normal form. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Geometry` | `Vec2`, `Vec3`, AABB/AABB2, frames, affine transforms, and compact symmetric 2D/3D carriers. |
| `Moonlight.LinAlg.Statics` | Statics types, assembly, equilibrium compilation, and support checking. |

The `Moonlight.LinAlg.Pure.*`, `Moonlight.LinAlg.Internal.*`, and
`Moonlight.LinAlg.Effect.*` leaves live in graded implementation sublibraries
(`carrier`, `structured`, `eigen`, `geometry`, `dense`, `domain`, `sparse`,
`statics`, `spectral`, `native`), with the dependency DAG cabal-enforced and
native linkage confined to `moonlight-linalg-native`. Public callers use
the public modules above; the slice modules define implementation ownership behind that
public vocabulary.

Hackage's package page aggregates dependencies from the main library, every
sublibrary, tests, and benchmarks. A normal consumer inherits only the
components named in its own `build-depends`; depending on `moonlight-linalg`
does not pull in the laws, test harness, native backend, or benchmark closure.

## Benchmark artifacts

Repository tooling generates benchmark artifacts:

```sh
scripts/tooling/generate_moonlight_linalg_bench_artifacts.py
```

The generator runs `cabal test moonlight-linalg-test -j1`, then runs the
short default `moonlight-linalg-bench` target with a CSV `tasty-bench` report and
renders SVG artifacts under `/tmp` by default. Use `--output-dir` to choose a
destination.

The default bench is decomposed across dense-row validation, dense decompositions/solvers,
sparse storage, sparse iterative solvers, domain algebra, GF(2), exterior powers,
geometry/statics, spectral demand dispatch, sparse Krylov, native LAPACK, and
structured projected block eigensolve. Heavier strata stay opt-in:

- `--broad-medium` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_BROAD_MEDIUM=1`
- `--broad-large` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_BROAD_LARGE=1`
- `--sparse-large` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_SPARSE_LARGE=1`
- `--include-100k` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_100K=1`
- `--projected-medium` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_PROJECTED_MEDIUM=1`
- `--large-projected` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_PROJECTED_LARGE=1`
- `--native-large` / `MOONLIGHT_LINALG_BENCH_ENABLE_NATIVE_LARGE=1`

Use `--diagnostic-sweep` for the medium broad rows, 50k sparse row, and
144-dimensional projected rows.

The default native LAPACK group keeps small DSYEV rows and a small DSTEMR
selected-tridiagonal row. The 10k DSTEMR path-Laplacian row is opt-in because it
is a native-boundary stress case for deeper runs.

For a fast local sanity sweep, skip the default calibrated sampling ceremony:

```sh
cabal bench moonlight-linalg:moonlight-linalg-bench -j1 --benchmark-options='--once'
```

This executes every default benchmark row once through the same workload owners
and reports the slowest rows. Use the calibrated default only when the numbers
are going into evidence.

Benchmark outputs are generated explicitly for each measurement run.

## Relationship to external linear-algebra packages

General-purpose Haskell linear algebra packages are better choices for ordinary
numerical applications. `moonlight-linalg` exists because Pale Meridian needs compact
compiler-local carriers, GF(2) and integer-domain hooks, exact shape/domain failures,
and structured Krylov/projected-operator types that compose with the rest of the
Moonlight foundation stack. Its strongest hot path is selected structured spectra,
especially path-Laplacian/tridiagonal modes. Dense nested rows serve validated
authoring. The native LAPACK boundary is deliberately effectful and isolated from
pure APIs.
