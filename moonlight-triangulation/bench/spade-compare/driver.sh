#
# Refinement is excluded from the cross-implementation half. Ruppert's
# algorithm admits many valid outputs for one input, so Steiner count,
# placement and insertion order are ours to move; the two sides are not
# expected to agree and never have. The complete gate corpora are pinned per
# side below, so a refinement change that alters either mesh still has to be a
# deliberate one.
#
# Interpolation weights are also excluded, for a different and precise reason.
# Sibson weights are geometrically determined and both sides compute each
# neighbour's stolen area with the same operation sequence, so the neighbour
# SETS are exact-predicate determined and cross implementations (they are
# diffed above like everything else). But the normalization total accumulates
# those areas in each side's own neighbour order — spade's internal
# edge-buffer order against moonlight's BFS-seeded boundary order, with
# different cyclic start points — and floating-point addition is not
# associative, so the normalized weights cannot be bit-identical across
# implementations. The complete gate corpora are pinned per side below, so an
# arithmetic change on either side still has to be a deliberate one.
