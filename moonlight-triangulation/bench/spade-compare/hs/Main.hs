-- | Haskell half of the spade external referent.
--
-- @moonlight-triangulation@ is a port of the Rust @spade@ crate, so spade is the
-- referent that grades it. Both halves generate their inputs from the same LCG
-- with the same seeds and emit their gate output in the same encoding, so
-- neither side can reformat a disagreement into agreement.
--
-- Vertex handles are NOT comparable across the two implementations — both bulk
-- loaders reorder. Anything naming a vertex names it by input index or by
-- coordinate, never by handle.
