-- few thousand of them and locating it lands on a face. A chord that starts
-- OUTSIDE the hull takes a different route on each side — spade walks the hull
-- from the located hull edge while this side falls back to a scan over every
-- element — so those chords are the "intersection-outside" cliff lane and are

-- one branch of three. The first family joins vertices the constraint
-- generator's index pairs select, which starts and ends the walk on a vertex;

-- an overlap. Both name their endpoints by coordinate, the second from a list
-- both sides sort by the same encoding, because vertex handles do not cross.
