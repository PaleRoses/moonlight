-- | Disjoint split cells, stacked in y: the points, the vertical constraints
-- the build starts from, and the crossing requests. Band @i@ carries a
-- constraint from (16, 4i) to (16, 4i + 2) and a crossing request from
-- (0, 4i + a) to (32, 4i + b), with a and b jittered inside the band, so every
-- request crosses exactly one constraint and no request reaches another band.
--
-- The geometry is chosen so the split point is not merely close on the two
-- sides but identical. spade solves the two line equations by Cramer's rule and
-- this side walks the parametric form; here every coefficient either vanishes
-- or is a power of two, both reduce to one rounding of @u + (v - u) / 2@, and
-- neither can round it differently. A generic crossing would leave the two
-- formulas free to disagree in the last bit and there would be nothing to gate.
