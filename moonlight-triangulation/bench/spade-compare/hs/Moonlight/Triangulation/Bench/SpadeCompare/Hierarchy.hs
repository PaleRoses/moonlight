-- | The step both insertion lanes run: one insert, one hierarchy update, and
-- nothing between them. It is what spade's @insert@ does internally through
-- @notify_vertex_inserted@, and both sides carry branch factor 16.
--
-- The point handed to 'updateHierarchyAfterInsertion' is the same binding
-- handed to 'insertVertexAt', never one read back out of the harness's input
-- vector. The mesh stores 'canonicalPoint' of what it was given, so a
-- harness-side copy would part company from it on a signed zero, seed a
-- different nearest neighbour, and move the gate against spade. Same function,
-- same argument, same bits.

-- | Arrival-order insertion with the hierarchy maintained alongside it.
--
-- One session spans the whole run. The hierarchy no longer asks for a
-- triangulation, so the per-point publication that existed only to hand it one
-- is gone: the mesh is thawed once and published once for the program, where
-- before it was once per point. The measured operation is unchanged — still an
-- insert per point with the hint maintained against it, which is spade's loop.

-- | The same step over a mesh that already holds every point, which is the
-- duplicate lane. Each insert locates a site that is already there and answers
-- 'AlreadyPresent', so the hierarchy comes back unexamined and the level walk
-- is never entered. What remains on the clock is the locate and the
-- disposition test, with no rebuild standing behind either.

-- | Remove a program of coordinates through the hierarchy: every locate
-- starts at the hierarchy's nearest sample, one base session publishes once,
-- and the hierarchy of the resulting value is published once.
--
-- No query observes an intermediate hierarchy in this lane. A triangulation
-- and its hierarchy denote their current values rather than the edit history,
-- so the lawful physical schedule is one base session followed by one
-- hierarchy publication — the shape of the strict side's
-- @HierarchyTriangulation@, whose removals also locate through the hierarchy.

-- | The hierarchy lanes' gate, in two parts. The base mesh alone would not see

-- bad hint still walks to the right answer; a hint naming a vertex that does
-- not exist, or one the search cannot walk out of, moves the answers. Both are
-- pinned.
