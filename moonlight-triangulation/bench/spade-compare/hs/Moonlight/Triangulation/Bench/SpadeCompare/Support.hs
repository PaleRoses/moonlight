-- | The same generated points flattened onto a sliver a picometre thick. No

-- face-building path; what collapses is the angular spread the bulk loaders
-- index their hulls by. That collapse is the whole of what this input

-- Uniqueness does not need general position, only one valid answer. A
-- collinear set admits exactly one triangulation — the chain of consecutive
-- segments, @n - 1@ of them and no triangle — so the canonical edge set is
-- fully determined and gates bit for bit against the strict side. Both
-- implementations state that same count as their own degenerate Euler
