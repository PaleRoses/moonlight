-- | The refinement lane's own counters, so the worklist question is answered by
-- measurement rather than by assertion.
--
-- @faceChecks@ is not a worklist counter: the terminal audit runs the complete
-- face evaluation over every final inner face without popping anything. So the
-- amplification ratio is @pops / steiner@, and @faceChecks - pops@ should equal
-- the final inner-face count less any pop discarded as excluded.
-- | The circle sweep's placement split, on the same generator the bulk lanes
-- use. A point takes the fast path when the hull edge its own angle selected
-- has the point strictly to its left; otherwise it is deferred to a generic
-- insertion after the sweep finishes. spade takes the identical branch on
-- @is_on_right_side_or_on_line@ and its own source calls that fallback "very
-- slow", so a materially non-zero skip count is wasted work in the bulk lane
-- rather than a curiosity. @seed + fast + skipped@ must exhaust the unique
-- points; this reports the identity rather than asserting it silently.
