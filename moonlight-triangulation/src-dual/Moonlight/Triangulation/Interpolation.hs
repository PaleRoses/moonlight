  -- 'flatness' is 0.5 or 1 in practice and @**@ is an exp/log pair per natural
  -- neighbour per query, so both are answered directly. The two shortcuts do
  -- not stand on the same ground.
  --
  -- The identity is exact. @x@ raised to 1 is @x@, which is already a float,
  -- and rounding an exactly representable result admits only that result, so
  -- any implementation faithful to within an ulp returns it.
  --
  -- The square root is not exact and does not need to be. IEEE-754 mandates a
  -- correctly rounded 'sqrt'; @pow@ is a recommended operation carrying no such
  -- requirement. Where the two disagree it is therefore in the last ulp, and it
  -- is 'sqrt' that holds the correctly rounded answer — this substitution can
  -- only move the result toward it. Against this platform's libm they in fact
  -- agree on every non-negative binary32 and on every non-negative binary64
  -- sampled, which is a measurement and not a proof.
  --
  -- They part company at negative zero, where @pow@ answers @+0@ and 'sqrt'
  -- answers @-0@. A sum of two squares is never negative zero, and were it one
  -- the sole consumer below tests @== 0@, which both zeroes satisfy alike.
