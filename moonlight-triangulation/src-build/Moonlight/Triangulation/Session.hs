-- | An edit sequence against one thawed mesh.
--
-- The two published entry points before this one — an insertion session and a
-- removal session — each handed the caller a function and could not compose,
-- so a caller who wanted to remove a hundred vertices and insert fifty thawed
-- twice and paid the O(n) publication a session exists to delete. They are the
-- same transaction; only the verb differed. This is that transaction, and the
-- verbs are its primitives.
--
-- The public session algebra and the private exact-site single-insertion
-- interpreter cross the same hidden transaction boundary. Sessions provide
-- composition; the private interpreter reaches that boundary only with
-- evidence from the immediately preceding frozen read. A fold of persistent
-- verbs and a session over the same verbs therefore differ only in which
-- intermediate meshes they publish.
--
-- Refusal short-circuits: the first 'BuildError' abandons the rest of the
-- sequence, and 'withSession' freezes nothing. A partly edited arena cannot
-- reach a caller as a published triangulation.
