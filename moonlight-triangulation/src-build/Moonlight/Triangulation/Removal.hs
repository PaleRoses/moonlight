-- This is a session over a single 'excise', which is what makes replacing a
-- fold of it with one session sound: the two agree on every mesh, and differ
-- only in how many of the intermediate ones are published. A fold publishes
-- @k@ meshes and pays a thaw for each, so it runs in Θ(n·k); the session pays
-- one thaw and runs in O(k·deg).

-- | Resolve a point through the mesh's exact derived identity section, then
