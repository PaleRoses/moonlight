-- | Descending, deduplicated. Both properties are load-bearing: swap-remove
-- must retire the high index first (a lower index shifts under it), and a
-- duplicated index would be retired twice.
--
-- A removal hands over its vertex's degree, which is small on ordinary meshes
-- and unbounded in the worst case, so the shape is chosen by size. Insertion
-- sort wins outright while the ring is short — measured 6.75 against
-- 8.24 KiB/removal for @IntSet@ on the n=10000 lane — and is quadratic, so a
-- high-degree ring goes to the ordered set that carries the asymptotics.
--
-- The lazy 'foldl' is deliberate: its accumulator is the output structure.
-- 'foldl'' forced each intermediate spine and measured 7.31 versus
-- 6.75 KiB/removal on the same lane.
