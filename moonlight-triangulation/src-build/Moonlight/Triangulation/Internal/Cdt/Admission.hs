-- | Immutable admission descends through the sparse constrained-edge section,
-- not through every ordinary edge in the requested corridor. Constraint
-- cardinality is the lawful index here: rejection depends only on a proper
-- crossing with an existing protected segment, while shared endpoints,
-- duplicate segments, and collinear overlap remain recoverable by the mutable
-- corridor algebra. Accepted singleton requests descend once more inside their
-- sealed transaction; the overwhelmingly common rejected request stops here
-- without thawing topology.
