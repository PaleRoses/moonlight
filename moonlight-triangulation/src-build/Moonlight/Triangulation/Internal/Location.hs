-- | Greedy first-improvement descent through vertex neighbours: hop to the
-- first neighbour strictly closer to the query until none improves. Distance
-- is a heuristic only — exact containment belongs to 'walk' — so the widened
-- comparison can lengthen the path but never move the located answer.
--
-- Strictly decreasing distance bounds the hops and nothing else: no vertex is
-- entered twice, but the star rotation terminates only if @reverse . previous@
-- closes an orbit, which is a property of the links rather than of the
-- geometry. Disjoint stars over distinct entered vertices spend at most one
-- step per outgoing half-edge, so a budget past 'directedEdgeCount' cannot be
-- exhausted while the links are well formed. Exhausting it means they are not,
-- and yields the vertex in hand rather than an error — a truncated descent can
-- only lengthen 'walk', never move what it finds.
