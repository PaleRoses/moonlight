-- | A Delaunay representative of the union of two site sets.
--
-- Skewed operands descend through the existing local copy-on-write session, so
-- the larger operand's vertex handles and untouched pages survive. Comparable
-- operands may merge along a separating seam or rebuild from their combined
-- site set. Every schedule returns valid topology;
-- 'Moonlight.Triangulation.Dcel.canonicalize' is the
-- separate physical observation when construction-independent numbering is
-- required.
--
-- Empty and structurally identical operands return an existing value verbatim.
-- Algebraic agreement between all schedules is stated by equal canonical
-- observations; structural equality continues to describe exact resident
-- representation.

-- | Combine by a balanced tournament rather than by a fold.
--
-- Associativity and commutativity make every bracketing canonically equivalent,
-- so this is a cost choice and not a semantic one. A left fold republishes an
-- accumulator that grows by one shard per step and so rebuilds @Θ(nk)@ sites
-- over @k@ shards; halving the list rebuilds @Θ(n log k)@.
--
-- The specialization below is load-bearing rather than decorative. Without it
-- this function is the only one on the path that stays polymorphic, and every
-- join in the tournament pays for a dictionary while a caller's own fold at a
-- known element type does not. That alone cost a factor of two and hid the
-- advantage this function exists for.
--
-- The tournament retains the binary operation's shortcut and annotation-gluing
-- semantics rather than inventing a second n-ary implementation.
