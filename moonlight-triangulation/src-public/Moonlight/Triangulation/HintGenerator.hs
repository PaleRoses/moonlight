--
-- No triangulation is named, for the reason 'updateHierarchyAfterInsertion'
-- gives: the only base position this repair cannot find in its own levels is
-- the relocated vertex's, and that is what the report carries.
--
-- Swap compaction moves exactly one vertex — the former last one, into the slot
-- the removed vertex vacated — so a level's sample sequence changes in at most
-- one place, and which place is decided by the two divisibilities the level's
-- divisor gives the freed slot and the vacated last index:
--
-- * neither is sampled: the level, and every coarser level above it, is
--   untouched, because a divisor that divides neither index is divided by no
--   multiple of itself either;
-- * the vacated index is sampled and the freed slot is not: the level loses its
--   last sample and nothing else;
-- * both are sampled: the level loses its last sample and that sample's point
--   lands in the freed slot's local position — which is the level's own swap
--   removal, mirroring the base's;
-- * the freed slot is sampled and the vacated index is not: the level keeps its
--   population and substitutes the relocated position at an interior local
--   slot. No removal expresses a substitution, so that level is rebuilt — from
--   its own points and the reported one, never from a mesh.
--
-- The last case is the only one that pays a build, and it is the rarest: it
-- needs the freed slot to be sampled and the vacated index not to be.
