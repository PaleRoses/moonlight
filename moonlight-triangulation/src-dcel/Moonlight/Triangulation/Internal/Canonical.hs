-- | Renumber a triangulation into its canonical representation.
--
-- Two triangulations of the same sites are the same triangulation — Delaunay
-- uniqueness says so, and the tie-break on an exactly cocircular quadrilateral
-- is keyed on coordinates rather than on identifiers so that it stays true.
-- What differs between two builds of one site set is only /numbering/: which
-- vertex got index 0, which half-edge got the even slot, where a face's cycle
-- was anchored. All of that records the schedule the value was constructed by,
-- and none of it is geometry.
--
-- This is what removes it. Every identifier is assigned from the geometry:
--
--     * vertices in lexicographic coordinate rank;
--     * undirected edges in lexicographic rank of their endpoint pair, each
--       taken low first, so the pair is an unordered pair by construction;
--     * of a pair's two half-edges, the even slot is the one leaving the
--       lower-ranked endpoint, which keeps twinning an @xor@ with one;
--     * inner faces in order of the least half-edge on their boundary, which
--       is a single index rather than a vertex tuple and so needs no special
--       case for a cycle that is not a triangle;
--     * every anchor — each vertex's outgoing edge, each face's edge — set to
--       the least admissible half-edge.
--
-- Construction therefore need not run in canonical order. Local insertion and
-- seam fusion may preserve their cheaper schedule-specific numbering; callers
-- invoke this operation only when they require the construction-independent
-- physical representative used to observe the finite-set laws.
--
-- Element payloads are @()@ because a renumbering is a bijection and could
-- carry them, but nothing that wants that exists; the writers a general form
-- would need were retired when their last caller went. Vertex payloads travel
-- with their vertices, and constraint flags with their edges, so a constrained
-- triangulation canonicalizes as readily as an unconstrained one.
