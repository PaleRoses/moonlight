-- | The normalization procedure of a confluent terminating rewrite system, and
-- one canonical legalization engine because a normalization procedure is what
-- it is.
--
-- The objects are the triangulations of a fixed point set. The single rule is
-- the Lawson flip: a locally illegal diagonal is replaced by the other
-- diagonal of its quadrilateral. A normal form is a mesh with no illegal
-- diagonal left to fire on.
--
-- /Termination/ is by the lifted-paraboloid potential. Send each point to
-- @(x, y, x² + y²)@ and read a triangulation as a piecewise-linear surface
-- over the point set; @illegalDiagonal@ is exactly the test that the flip
-- lowers that surface, so every rewrite strictly decreases it, and a finite
-- point set has finitely many triangulations. Exact cocircularity is the one
-- case where the surface does not move — the four lifted points are coplanar
-- and both diagonals give the same surface — so there the potential is the
-- diagonal's own key order, and the rule fires only downward in it. Without
-- that tie-break a cocircular quadrilateral flips forever.
--
-- /Confluence/ is Delaunay's theorem, in its strong form: a triangulation with
-- no locally illegal diagonal is globally Delaunay. Local normality is thus
-- global normality, the normal form is unique, and every rewrite order reaches
-- it. That is what licenses the arena below to be a LIFO stack rather than a
-- priority queue, and it is why callers may seed it in whatever order is
-- cheapest to produce — the fan first, or the hull turns first, or both
-- interleaved — without any of them changing the mesh that comes out.
--
-- All callers differ only in how they seed the arena; topology mutation and
-- propagation have exactly one owner.
-- The stack top, the maximum top, and the flip count are strict loop
-- variables, returned once when the drain finishes — the mesh reports nothing
-- per candidate, and 'applyFlip' reports nothing at all. The phantom
-- 'KnownProbe' parameter counts popped candidates for the instrumented lane
-- and is erased everywhere else.
--
-- A popped candidate is read once. Turning it against the star vertex, judging
-- it, and rewriting it are three questions about the same two half-edge
-- records, and the apex the turn looks for is the apex the judgement needs, so
-- one pass over the quadrilateral answers all three.
