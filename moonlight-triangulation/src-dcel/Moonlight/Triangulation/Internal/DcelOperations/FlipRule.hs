-- Lift the quadrilateral to @z = x² + y²@ and the in-circle sign is the
-- orientation of the lifted tetrahedron: 'GT' says the fourth point is below
-- the plane of the other three, so the current diagonal spans a fold the flip
-- pushes downward. 'EQ' says the four lifted points are coplanar and the flip
-- changes nothing about the surface — so the ordering on diagonal keys stands
-- in as the potential, and the rule fires only downward in it. That tie-break
-- is not a convention for picking among equals; it is what stops a cocircular

-- | The rewrite strategy: which candidates the flip rule is allowed to fire
-- on. Both laws leave the normal form alone — they restrict where the rule may
-- be applied, never what a legal diagonal is.
--
-- 'ValidMesh' legalizes a mesh that is already a triangulation. There a
-- non-convex quadrilateral's diagonal is necessarily locally Delaunay, so the
-- incircle rule itself declines the flip; separately re-running two exact
-- orientation predicates would only re-prove the incident-face premise.
--
-- 'CavityRepair' legalizes the fan that fills a removed vertex's hole, which is
-- not yet a triangulation. That implication fails on an inverted quadrilateral,
-- and the inverted one is exactly the one that must flip, so the short-circuit
-- becomes a refusal to perform the repair. The carried index is the undirected
-- edge count taken before the fan was built: every edge at or above it was
-- appended by the fan, and only those may flip, so a transiently inverted
-- neighbourhood cannot flip the cavity's border away.
