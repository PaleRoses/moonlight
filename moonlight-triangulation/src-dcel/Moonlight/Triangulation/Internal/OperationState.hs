-- | The state one operation owns while it works: the legalization arena, the
-- shared scratch arena, and the instrumentation cells. None of it is
-- topology, so none of it lives on @MutableDcel@ — a transaction allocates
-- this record when it thaws, hands it down to the operations it runs, and
-- reads the counters back once when it freezes. The hot loops thread their
-- stack top, maximum depth and flip count as strict loop variables and charge
-- these cells once per drain; cold events (one per insertion, one per walk
-- probe) charge them where they happen.

-- | One operation's working state. Scratch is fixed and raw: writes always
-- precede reads within an epoch. The legalization vector is held behind one
-- reference solely so an adversarial generic drain can grow it without
-- reintroducing mesh-global work state. A drain reads that reference once,
-- carries the vector and all stack metrics strictly, and stores it once when
-- finished; there is no per-candidate reference traffic.

-- | Allocate transaction-sized working state. The legalization reservation is a
-- starting size, not a semantic limit: a generic flip pops one candidate and may
-- push four, no linear worst-case depth follows from the input size, and
-- overflow grows the operation-owned vector by doubling. So the reservation is
-- capped. A transaction-sized one charges every singleton verb a fresh block
-- group whose tail no drain reaches, and the doublings that reach a real peak
-- copy less in total than reserving that tail costs.
--
-- Scratch retains four disjoint half-edge sections as its semantic limit: the
-- removal kernel locally glues border, retired-edge, retired-face, and new-fan
-- sections there. Its physical storage still grows only with the star or strip
-- actually observed. Reserving the full mesh bound made every singleton
-- persistent edit allocate an arena whose untouched tail was orders of
-- magnitude larger than the edit.
